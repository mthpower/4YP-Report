Cen X-3 is a very bright and well studied source, and as it\textquoteright{}s designation would suggest, was one of the first X-ray sources to be discovered. It is a SGXB, and so is powered primarily by stellar wind loss. It has a well documented 2.087 day cycle.

\ref{Figure 9} shows a binned lightcurve. Although this does not reveal anything useful, it is an example of a particularly good source. Cen X-3 is very luminous, and the error bars and count rates reflect this. \ref{Figure 8} shows a periodogram from Cen X-3. The expected peak at 2.087 days is very clear. Once folded on this period, \ref{Figure 9} shows the eclipse profile. From these results, it is easy to see that Cen X-3 shows the behaviour expected of a SGXB. It is luminous and active except when eclipsing, and provides a good example to measure other less well known and more uncertain sources against.
