INTEGRAL, the International Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, is a satellite launched in 2002. Containing four primary instruments, INTEGRAL looks at sources in energy ranges approximately between 5 keV and 10 MeV, from hard X-rays to Gamma rays. 

The INTEGRAL archive contains data for many sources that have not been fully explored. This project focuses on a sample of High Mass X-ray Binary sources thought to have eclipses. Lomb-Scarge spectral analysis and Phase Dispersion Minimisation are both used to find periodicities in the light curves of these sources.
