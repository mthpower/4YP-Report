INTEGRAL, the International Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, is a satellite launched in 2002. Containing four primary instruments, INTEGRAL looks at sources in energy ranges approximately between 5 keV and 10 MeV, from hard X-rays to Gamma rays. 

The INTEGRAL archive contains data for many sources that have not been fully explored. This project focuses on a sample of High Mass X-ray Binary sources including some thought to have eclipses or long term periodic variability. Lomb-Scarge spectral analysis and Phase Dispersion Minimisation is used to find periodicities in the light curves of these sources, and broadly categorise them into the 3 main classes of HXMB, the Supergiant X-ray Binaries, Superfast X-ray Transients, and Be Star X-ray Binaries. The project also discusses the utility of the methods used in finding periodicities in these sources.
